# Model Order Reduction of Linearized NSE with pyMOR

The Jupyter Notebook `pymor_nse_control.ipynb` demonstrates model order reduction
of the linearized Navier-Stokes equation which occurs in the control setup
described [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08711.pdf).

Model order reduction is performed using [pyMOR](https://github.com/pymor/pymor).
